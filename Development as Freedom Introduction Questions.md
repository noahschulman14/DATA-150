# 9/3 - Development as Freedom Introduction Questions

### What does Sen mean by the word development?

Sen defines development as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. He sees it as the expansion of freedoms of individuals rather than statistics like GNP or life expectancy.

### Is this a narrower or more expansive view of development?

This is a more expansive view of development because it does not simply focus on statistics like GNP. Expanding freedoms focuses on development in many facets of life. Amartya Sen puts freedom into 5 categories: social opportunities, political freedoms, economic facilities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Development of these freedoms offers a much broader view of development than life expectancy or GNP.

### What are some of the sources of unfreedoms that development requires to be removed?

One of the biggest points Sen touches on is the necessity for people to be able to participate in economic markets. If people don't have the freedom to exchange goods and services, they are severely limited in many facets of life. Freedom to generate your own wealth allows people to have free agency. Sen emphasizes how the Civil War was a major event, and how it eliminated many unfreedoms such as economic unfreedom. The Civil War allowed people the freedom to enter into contracts and to be compensated for their effort and time, leading to increased freedoms in other areas.

Sen also frequently mentions how unfreedom in one area leads to unfreedom in other areas. Such how Kader Mia was limited in his economic freedoms, and how this led to unfreedom in a social context as well as a health and security context.

### Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?

Allows people to take control of their own life, rather than relying on government programs or aid from other countries. People with free agency have the ability to choose their own path in life and determine their own potential, rather than depending on an outside entity to support them.

### What does Sen say about being generically against markets? 

Sen says that "being generically against market would be almost as odd as being generically against conversations between people." He says that freedom to exchange words, good, or gifts does not need justification, it is a part of how human beings live in society and interact with each other. He sees it as an extension of free speech and a natural right.

### Who will ultimately be correct, Condorcet or Malthus?

I believe that Condorcet will be correct. It is evident that fertility rates in developing countries are far lower than in developing countries, so as long as the world continues to develop, the fertility rate should go down. This can be seen in many European countries, where the population is actually decreasing, and most strikingly in Japan, where they are seeing a drastic reduction in population. 

Malthus believes that fertility rates will stay up as long as the resources to support the population is present. If this was the case,  America would have a much higher fertility rate than Africa, as they have access to far more resources, however the fertility rate in Africa is much higher than in America.
