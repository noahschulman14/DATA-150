# DATA-150

## Introduction

Hi, welcome to my DATA-150 GitHub page! My name is Noah Schulman, I'm from Annapolis, Maryland, and I'm currently a freshman at William and Mary. I am undecided on my major, but I am interested in data science, so maybe I'll decide to go with that after this class. I love skiing, I'm a huge Baltimore Ravens fan, and I have 2 dogs.
