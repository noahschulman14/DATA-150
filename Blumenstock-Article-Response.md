# 8/25 - Response to Joshua Blumenstock's "Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development" article in Nature.

With increasing numbers of people across the world having access to mobile phones, data scientists and researchers now have unprecedented levels of data to investigate, and in the right hands, it has the potential to solve some very large-scale and significant problems. As Blumenstock mentions, the technology to use this data has already been developed by large tech companies, it just needs to be adapted to help developing countries. I find it fascinating how we now have the ability to analyze complicated issues, like determining areas of poverty, based on identifying thatched roof houses from satellite images; this is something that would have been absolutely unthinkable just 30 years ago. Large scale projects that accelerate development will only increase as time goes on, and the “promises” Blumenstock highlights are extraordinary, but many factors need to be considered before aid organizations completely overhaul traditional methods of data collection and analysis with modern data science technologies.

As Blumenstock’s “pitfalls” prove, it would be naïve to think that the data science approach of solving these mass scale problems can totally replace traditional methods of data collection any time soon. The factors that go into analyzing problems in the developing world are extremely nuanced, but it is difficult for data scientists to detect the small details that comprise a larger problem without extensive testing. Blumenstock cites how data scientists use aspects of phone usage to determine if individuals are likely to pay off loans. While there may be a trend that shows wealthier people tend to use a mobile phone more, there are many other factors that go into whether a person can pay back a loan or not. Traditional methods of data collection, like face to face interviews, although much less efficient, is much more personalized, allowing for potentially overlooked factors that go into loan paybacks to be acknowledged. In many data science applications, it seems like a broad brushstroke of data is used to conclude very complicated problems. Face-to-face interaction helps to fill in the gaps that modern data science misses, and until smartphone usage reaches the entire population of developing countries, there will always be underdeveloped areas that will be ignored by modern data science. For the time being, a hybrid approach that utilizes both traditional and modern data collection and analysis techniques, like the World Food Programme’s aid efforts in Haiti that Blumenstock mentions, is necessary to ensure that the developing world receives quality and wide-spread solutions to their problems.

Most importantly however, this technology needs to fall into the right hands. Blumenstock briefly touches on how the Chinese government utilizes data science to implement a sort-of dystopian police state, a reality that doesn’t seem unlikely in the developing world where authoritarian governments could use this technology for nefarious purposes. It is crucial that this powerful technology has much oversight in the developing world to ensure that more help than harm is done. Aid organizations should tread carefully when implementing data science in the developing world as they face real issues that require well developed solutions.
