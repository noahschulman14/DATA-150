# 10/15 Owen Barder Questions



### 1. How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definiiion to include the idea of complexity?

Owen Barder uses Amartya Sen’s definition of development. He uses a quote from Sen stating how the quality of people’s lives are improved when they have a greater range of freedoms to enjoy. Development is also often seen as merely improving simple factors such as GDP and access to healthcare in developing countries, but this view of development as well as Amartya Sen’s view of development are relatively linear ways of looking at development. Owen Barder argues that development is a complex process, just like natural processes like the human brain, ecosystems, and flocks of birds. He calls development and the economy a “complex adaptive system” where each system evolves according to many factors and can be adapted based on their specific circumstances. 

### 2. Who was Thomas Thwaites and what was his "toaster project"? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of Barder's talk about complexity and development?

Thomas Thwaites was a British design student who set out to make a simple, run of the mill toaster from scratch. He had a very hard time finding the materials necessary to build this standard toaster, but after many months, he was able to construct the toaster successfully. Though he was able to get it to work, it only worked for a few seconds before it caught on fire. Barder uses this example to illustrate how complex the economy and first world infrastructure is in building a simple toaster. There has to be a wide array of processes involved in areas like manufacturing, shipping, and collection of raw materials to make a simple product like a toaster. There are countless factors that go into making that toaster: here needs to be an effective financial system in place, an established global shipping supply line,  part manufacturers working in partnership, and an working electrical grid to name a few. For a country to develop, it needs to create these myriad systems in order to industrialize and become a first world economy. This is something that takes time and is unique to each country’s circumstances. 

### 3. Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010. Why was this example instructive as part of his talk? What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate (or invalidate) economic models?

Barder compares South Korea and Ghana because at one point they both had a very similar income per person. Over time however, South Korea was able to develop and drastically increase their income per person while Ghana remained underdeveloped. Barder uses this example to illustrate how previous development and economic theories are too simple to explain why countries are able to develop. Barder talks about several classic development and economic growth models and how they had minor differences between them to explain why countries develop. None of these models however were able to explain why South Korea was able to develop faster than Ghana. Barder uses this to explain how development and economic development is much more complex than a simple linear model, there are countless factors that work together and are unique to each country's circumstances. He goes on to say how simple linear models simply won’t work, they never have; it is time to switch to a complex adaptive model, similar to the processes in the human brain and in natural ecosystems, to explain the process of development. 

### 4. What was the Harrod-Domar model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what the impact of his work on development? Was the Harrod-Domar model effective at predicting development outcomes?

The Harrod-Domar model was an economic model used after WWII. The model stated that in order to make a certain amount of output, you needed a certain amount of capital and labor. The Harrod-Domar was not effective for predicting real life development outcomes, which Owen Barder illustrates with his South Korea and Ghana development comparison, as it is not explained by the Harrod-Domar model. Walter Rostow created another economic model. Rostow’s model was hugely influential in the field of development, with many NGOs and governments using this model to determine how much foreign aid should go to a developing country.

### 5. What was the Robert Solow model and how did it address the limitations of the Harrod-Domar model? Was this model successful as predicting economic growth?

Rober Solow created the “neoclassical growth model.” This model added a new component to the old Harrod-Domar model; it added a third component called “technological change.” Barder says that this model is much more applicable to the real world than the Harrod-Domar model. Barder does have quite a few qualms with this model however, stating how “technological change” is not a clearly defined entity and how the model isn’t really a model at all, merely a form of accounting. Barder goes on to say how this model is not successful in predicting economic growth, pointing to examples in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### 6. What was the Washington Consensus? How did it propose to improve upon models of economic growth?

The Washington Consensus was a list of policy actions to promote development created by the World Bank and the IMF. The Washington Consensus proposed that a simple list of policy reforms would be able to stimulate economic growth in a developing country. Their theory was that policy failures were what was limiting economic growth in a particular country. After many years of following this idea, economists later came to the conclusion that it is not policy failures that stunted development, it was institutions. 

### 7. What was the Ajaokuta Steel Works? How did it illustrate the transition from a focus on policies to institutions.  How productive has the Nigerian steel works proven to be?

Ajaokuta Steel Works is one of the largest steel investments in the world. It cost the Nigerian government an extraordinary amount of money. It was thought that this steel mill would stimulate economic growth as it aligned with the mainstream economic development models at the time. The steel mill never actually went in use however and it has never produced any steel. This is due to corruption, and this was a major turning point in development as people began to see that institutions were the problem with stunted development, not policies. 

### 8. Who was Haile Sellasie?  What is the significance of Kapuscinski's book the Emperor? How did Ethiopia exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change? Do you agree with Barder's interpretation?

Haile Sellasie was one of the last Emperors of feudal Ethiopia. Kapuscinski’s book, the Emperor, details the last days of this ruler, it is also the book that made Kapuscinski famous. This book illustrated how authoritarian rule suppressed emergent economic and systemic change. This keeps the power centralized at the top while stunting economic development among the majority of people. 

### 9. Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at Uni-Lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?

Steve Jones is currently a famous evolutionary biologist. At Uni-Lever, he was tasked with creating a better nozzle for making soap powder. Instead of working out which nozzle model would work best based on engineering or physics, he made random variations of soap powder nozzles and tested which ones worked best. He was extraordinarily successful, with his best nozzle variation being hundreds of times more efficient than the old nozzle. This was instrumental in showing the concept of complex adaptive change, and this idea is now applied to various areas such as evolutionary biology.

### 10. What is the significance of Schumpeter's idea of creative destructive? How does it relate to firms and industries?

The idea of creative destruction is that old firms are replaced by new firms who better adapt to the current environment. This is exemplified in the brand Nokia, where they used to make rubber tires, and then switched to making cell phones to better keep up with the current economic environment. Now Nokia is becoming a victim of creative destruction, as they are not making smartphones that will allow them to compete in the current economic climate. 

### 11. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? Does he suggest a different approach?  What did he mean by his use of the term, iso-morphic mimicry?

Barder recommends resisting engineering as a policy implication because it is nearly impossible to predict specific outcomes because there are so many variables that go into development. Just like how Steve Jones wasn’t able to engineer a better soap nozzle, he instead went by the "evolutionary adaptive system" way of thinking, putting slight variations into the soap nozzles until it evolved into a much more ideal design. 

### 12. What did Barder mean by “resist fatalism”? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?

When Barder says to “resist fatalism” he means that we do not have to accept whatever outcome the process of evolution leaves us with. Norman Borlaug intervened in the evolutionary process of wheat crops in order to create better high-yield, disease resistant wheat varieties. This brought about the green revolution where crops are now crossbred and actively selected to create crops with more desirable qualities. This relates to the idea of resisting fatalism because we can change, accelerate, and shape the process of evolution instead of accepting the natural outcome of evolution.
