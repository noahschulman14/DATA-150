# Human Development & Data Science Insights 2 - Detecting Malaria with Deep Learning

Malaria is a deadly disease that is common all over the world, especially in underdeveloped regions. Nearly half the world’s population is at risk of contracting malaria, with 2 million cases every year and 400,000 deaths. Malaria parasites can also live in a human for over a year without them showing any symptoms, so it is imperative that people get tested as soon as possible after being bit by a mosquito in a malaria present area. The traditional means of detecting malaria in a person is very labor intensive however. The traditional method for testing a person for malaria involves smearing blood onto a sheet of film and having a human observer look for malaria parasites under a microscope. The accuracy of this method relies heavily on human expertise and is also very labor intensive as observers have to individually count infected and uninfected red blood cells. This method of malaria testing is obviously not ideal, especially in underdeveloped countries where people with proper expertise are not readily available. Newer methods of malaria detecting like rapid diagnostic tests also exist, however many areas most affected by malaria aren’t able to afford such testing in mass quantities. 

The traditional method of malaria testing can be improved however with the use of deep learning computer vision models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Due to its ability to extract features from a picture, CNNs are normally used in biometric analysis such as facial recognition or in Natural Language Processing to read words in text or writing. CNNs are now being used more and more in developing contexts as it is useful in a variety of applications. CNNs are composed of multiple connected layers, each with a certain type of filter to detect specific features in an image. As the neural network progresses, the filters get more complex, with the early filters detecting simple patterns like edges or corners, and the latter filters detecting more complex features like feathers, arms, and eventually entire objects. Due to its incredible ability to detect patterns across space, CNNs could be the solution to the current problems with traditional malaria testing methods.

Dipanjan Sarkar details how such a CNN would have to be trained. Sarkar explains how pre-labeled images of various types of malaria and non-malaria infected blood smears have to be utilized to “train” the CNN. In Sarkar’s case he is using images from the National Library of Medicine. The images were first taken on mobile phones from a hospital in Bangladesh, and then manually labeled by expert malaria test practitioners in Thailand. The labeled dataset is then used to train the CNN in a machine learning environment like TensorFlow. Once a CNN is trained, it should be able to detect features in a new image based on patterns analyzed in the training datasets. After accuracy assessments, it is ready to be used on real malaria blood samples. In real world applications, CNNs have been 95.9% accurate in detecting malaria in a variety of samples. 

Sarkar also explains the concept of Deep Transfer Learning, which involves reformatting deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks into a new context. In Sarkar’s experiment, he reformats the VGG-19 model, which is used for image detection and classification, for use in detecting features in malaria samples. Sarkar made several new models based on deep learning models used for other applications, and then did accuracy assessments on each of them to see which one works best for malaria detection purposes. 

Once data scientists distinguish which models work best for their specific application, the CNN can then be ported into a mobile app, where healthcare workers in underdeveloped countries can take a photo of a malaria blood smear and get test results in seconds. This not only alleviates the potential for human error, but is also much less cost and labor intensive than traditional testing means.
