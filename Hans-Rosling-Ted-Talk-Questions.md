# 9/3 - Hans Rosling Ted Talk Questions

### What is the difference between the Western world's preconceived ideas and reality?

It seems like people from the West have a western bias. For example, when Rosling tested his undergrad Scandinavian students on child mortality rates between Western and non-western countries, they were quick to believe that Western countries had a lower child mortality rate, when in reality this wasn't the case. Many Western people assume that Western countries are superior and more developed in terms of GDP, healthcare, and many other factors. In reality many non-western countries are more highly developed in certain areas when compared to the West, and even some lesser developed countries do better in certain aspects.

### Which comes first, health or wealth? Describe the role of healthcare and education in human development.

Health is a precursor to wealth. Rosling uses the example of South Korea, and how it was able to develop faster than both Brazil and Uganda because it started out healthier in terms of child survival rate, despite Brazil starting with the highest GDP. There seems to be a trend that the quicker a country develops healthcare, the quicker the country's wealth and overall development increases.

Healthcare and education are prerequisites for development. It is difficult to sustain and develop wealth and infrastructure when the population is uneducated and has a low life expectancy. When a country develops sufficient healthcare, the population can focus on more than staying alive, allowing them to devote more time and resources towards other areas of development. Education is important because it allows for a country's population to become skilled laborers and develop a plan for sustainable development. In the developing context, healthcare and education is not an expensive endeavor, however it is very labor and time intensive.
